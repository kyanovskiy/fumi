                        <p class="slideInUp slideInUp2">StringTheory is a seed to sale tracking and reporting system of modules that address real-time tracking, accounting, management, and regulatory business challenges. From cultivators, who are required to track each plant and its yield and waste; to testing facilities, required to certify potency and safety; to dispensaries required to track and report sales, StringTheory provides a platform for each industry professional to input and record mandated and voluntary data, and - where warranted - track this information throughout the lifecycle of the product. This information is stored, aggregated, and formatted to comply with state and local reporting mandates imposed in states that require it. Because industry professionals can buy only what they need, StringTheory can be used as a complete standalone solution, or can interface with existing software products in the market to supplement existing deficiencies in third party applications. StringTheory modules can be customized to accommodate any nationalized reporting structure. FumiWare has designed each module not only to integrate seamlessly with each other, but to interface with third party software products such as QuickBooks and other leading cannabis business software products. Such integration means a larger revenue stream, and gives FumiWare the ability to address third party software deficiencies for those users who have existing software products. </p>

From cannabinoid information including THC and CBD levels, to actual user reviews relating to performance quality, BuzzKill allows users at all levels access to free real-time information about strain, potency, and quality of cannabis. BuzzKill also acts as an early warning system in the event a product needs to be recalled for any reason. All users will have immediate access to grower, manufacturer, and dispensary warnings related to dosing, pesticides, or other issues along with information on the effects and use methodology regarding cannabis products. Users and professionals can receive real-time cannabis use information, including warnings and alerts, through their smartphones. BuzzKill interfaces with both StringTheory and third-party software at the data level. Having the full set of data through the lifecycle allows FumiWare us to add value to the life cycle analysis of cannabis, further enabling the formation of brands, growing regions, organic certifications, and medical information. Together, BuzzKill and StringTheory create a comprehensive set of data that can be leveraged for commercial and academic purposes, allowing research into the effects and benefits of various strains, chemovars or other manufacturing formulations. FumiWare is committed to making data open to non-profit and academic organizations, and protecting the anonymity of our end users. </p>
